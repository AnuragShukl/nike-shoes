Nike Shoes Hub
During the summer, I embarked on a quest to find the perfect Nike shoes. After visiting several e-commerce websites, including the official Nike website, I discovered that some old models were still available, and the new models lacked sufficient reviews. To simplify the search for the latest trends and best-fitting shoes, I created the Nike Shoes Hub.

Trending Shoes: View the most trending Nike shoes based on user preferences.
New Models: Explore the latest Nike shoe releases with up-to-date information.
AI-Based Recommendation: Coming soon! An AI-powered application will recommend the most suitable Nike shoes based on user personality and intended use.
